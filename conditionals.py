# In programming, conditionals are like a fork in the road. They allow your code to make decisions based on whether a condition is True or False.
# the symbols for conditionals in Python are: ==, !=, >, <, >=, <=
# The "if" statement is used to execute a block of code if a specified condition is true.
# The "else" statement is used to execute a block of code if the specified condition is false.
# The "elif" (short for "else if") statement is used to check multiple conditions in sequence.
