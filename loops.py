# Part 1 
# Basics of python loops not good real slow
#print("Cool")
#print("Cool")
#print("Cool")

# Part 2 (do not run this code it will run forever)
# while loop for better performance and readability its a boolean infinite loop 
# infinite loop
# i = 3
#while i != 0:
#   print("Cool")

# part two while loop for better performance and readability its a boolean infinite loop
# i = 3 means it will run 3 times.
# i -= 1 means it will run 3 times and then stop.
# if you say negative number there is a infinite loop and it will run forever.
#i = 7 # start the loop at 3
#while i != 0: #true
#    print("Cool")
#    i -= 1 # stop the loop after 3 times

# if 1 is less than or equal to 3 then print cool 3 times
i = 1
while i <= 3: # print 3 times if 1 <= 3 then print cool 3 times
    print("Cool")
    i += 1 # increment i by 1 each time the loop runs

# for loops allows us to loop through a sequence (such as a list, tuple, dictionary, set, or string). a set of items that we want to loop through.
